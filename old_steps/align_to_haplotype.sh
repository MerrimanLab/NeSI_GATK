# You can use chain jobs to create dependencies between jobs.
# This is often the case if a job relies on the result of one
# or more preceding jobs.
# Chain jobs can also be used if the runtime limit of the
# batch queues is not sufficient for your job.
# SLURM has an option -d or "--dependency" that allows to
# specify that a job is only allowed to start if another job finished.
# Here is an example how a chain job can looks like, the example submits 3 jobs
# (Pre-Processing Job, MPI job and finally the Post-Processing Job)
# that will be executed on after each other
